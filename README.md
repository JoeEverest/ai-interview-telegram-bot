# Instructions

I use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a webhook URL locally.
- Install [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/) and run it
- Then start it at the same port as the api.
- Check your email for the .env file I used and update the ngrok url to the one you create.
- I also put the API token for the bot on the email .env
